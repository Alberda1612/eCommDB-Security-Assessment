## Introduction
Welcome to the eCommDB-Security-Assessment repository! This project focuses on conducting a vulnerability assessment of an e-commerce company's database server, which has been exposed to the public for the past three years. The goal is to identify potential risks and propose effective security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure the integrity of our business operations. By addressing these vulnerabilities, we aim to enhance the overall security posture of our organization and mitigate potential threats.

## Objectives
1. To conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment of the company's database.
2. To identify potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with the open-to public server.
3. Evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities on the companys business operations and customer data security.
4. To propose effective security measures to mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall securty of the database.
5. Provide clear and concise documentation on security best practices and guidelines for the company's employees.

## Skils / Concepts Demonstrated 
1. Vulnerability Assessment.
2. Risk Analysis.
3. Security Best Practice
4. Access Control and Authentication
5. Communication and Reporting.

## Background Information
An E-commerce company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

_**Task**_: The task is to conduct a vulnerability assessment of the e-commerce company's database server to access the current state of the database server, evaluate the server's security, identify potential security risks and vulnerabilities, and propose effective security measures to mitigate those risks.
